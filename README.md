# Creating Blog Application Using Laravel 5.7 and Php 7.2

Hey everyone, my name is Henry and welcome to building a blog application tutorial with python 3 and Django web framework. One of the main question developers ask is, why create a blog application tutorial? It seems like everyone recreate a blog as a first application. Well, there is a reason for that, first of all. Everyone knows how a blog works and this make it easy for learning. When I tell you we are creating a blog, you automatically know that there is some sort of authentication system, posts are going to be the main element, there will be a page that list all the post in a particular order e.g chronologically and you also know each of these post will have comments.
